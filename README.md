Project Motivation: It's hard to organize house tasks when you have few roommates/housemates. I've made this simple webapp to CRUD tasks for now, I'll be updating it and I'll be adding a user resource, and I'm also gonna be using google calendar api to integrate reminders.

Design: This project is designed with node.js runtime environment and tested on localhost with express, and uses mongoDB as database

Code Structures: Includes a main server.js file, routes that work with controllers to do requests and response, and a mongoDB schema that defines the "Task" data
